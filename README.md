Notes:

All files should be initially encoded as UTF-8. This isn't the default for some IDEs, so you should change that in the preferences. Line endings of text files are Windows format (CR-LF). That should be the default in any Windows IDE.

We will use Maven Project Template.

We will use Canvas email to communicate.

Package and class names must be agreed upon.

Everyone must create their own branch from the master branch. The head of each member's branch will be merged into the master branch for grading. The project's final version should receive a Git tag 'SearchEngine Project-Data”.
The team is using the XML schema.
THe elements are: <element name= 'file' type ='string'/>
                  <element name= 'fileID' type = 'integer'/>
                  <element name='filePath' type = 'string'/>
                  <element name= 'dateAdded' type = 'string'/>.
